Running Large Language Models (LLMs) usually means sending user data to the cloud. But on modern Android devices, LLMs can run fully offline, locally, using Kotlin.
This article shows how to run LLMs offline on Android using Kotlin, with no servers, no API keys, and full user privacy-using Llamatik, a Kotlin-first wrapper around llama.cpp.

## Why run LLMs offline on Android?

Cloud-based LLMs come with tradeoffs:
- ❌ Network dependency
- ❌ Latency
- ❌ Usage-based cost
- ❌ User data leaving the device

Offline LLMs enable:
- 📴 Offline-first apps
- 🔐 Privacy-preserving AI
- 📱 Predictable performance and cost

Modern Android phones are powerful enough-the missing piece has been good Kotlin tooling.

## llama.cpp: the foundation for on-device LLMs

llama.cpp is a high-performance C++ runtime designed to run LLMs efficiently on CPUs.

It supports:
- Quantized GGUF models
- ARM CPUs (Android)
- No GPU or cloud dependency

But integrating C++ directly into Android apps is painful.
That's where Llamatik comes in.

## What is Llamatik?

Llamatik is a Kotlin-first library that lets Android developers run llama.cpp locally using a clean Kotlin API.

Key features:
- Fully offline inference
- No JNI in app code
- Kotlin Multiplatform support
- GGUF model compatibility
- Streaming & embeddings support

You write only Kotlin-native complexity stays hidden.

## Add Llamatik to your Android project

Llamatik is published on Maven Central.

```
dependencies {
 implementation("com.llamatik:library:0.12.0")
}
```

No custom Gradle setup.
No NDK configuration.

## Add a GGUF model

Download a quantized GGUF model (e.g. Q4) and place it in:
```
androidMain/assets/
└── phi-2.Q4_0.gguf
```

Smaller models load faster and work better on mobile devices.

## Load the model

```
val modelPath = LlamaBridge.getModelPath("phi-2.Q4_0.gguf")
LlamaBridge.initGenerateModel(modelPath)
```

This copies the model from assets and loads it into native memory.

## Generate text offline

```
val response = LlamaBridge.generate(
 "Explain Kotlin Multiplatform in one sentence."
)
```

That's it.
No internet.
No API keys.
No cloud calls.

## Streaming generation (recommended)

For chat-style UIs:
```
LlamaBridge.generateStreamWithContext(
 system = "You are a concise assistant.",
 context = "",
 user = "List three benefits of offline LLMs.",
 onDelta = { token -> /* update UI */ },
 onDone = { },
 onError = { error -> }
)
```

This works seamlessly with:
- Jetpack Compose
- StateFlow
- ViewModels

## Embeddings & offline RAG

Llamatik also supports embeddings, enabling offline search and RAG use cases.

```
LlamaBridge.initModel(modelPath)
val embedding = LlamaBridge.embed("On-device AI with Kotlin")
```

Store embeddings locally to build fully offline AI features.

## Performance notes

On-device LLMs have limits:
- Use quantized models
- Expect slower responses than cloud GPUs
- Manage memory carefully

But for:
- Assistive features
- Short prompts
- Domain-specific tasks

Performance is more than good enough.

## When should you use offline LLMs?

Llamatik is ideal when you need:
- Offline support
- Strong privacy guarantees
- Predictable costs
- Tight UI integration

It's not a replacement for large cloud models-it's edge AI done right.

## Final thoughts
Running LLMs offline on Android using Kotlin is no longer experimental.
With the right tools, Kotlin developers can build private, offline, on-device AI-without touching C++.
If you're curious about mobile AI beyond the cloud, this is a great place to start.
